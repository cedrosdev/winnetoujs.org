<h1>Setting Up Your Application</h1>

<p>
  You can start a Winnetou project from scratch or add the library's constructos and functionality to your existing code. Here we will show you how to start an app from scratch.
</p>

<h2>
  Everything you need, in 3 lines.
</h2>

<p>
  To start a Winnetou project from scratch, open the terminal and type:
</p>


<pre class="terminal">
  npm init -y;
  npm install --save-dev winnetoujs;
  node wbr --scaffolding;
</pre>

<p>
  <code>npm init -y;</code> To start a project that can install modules from npm.
</p>

<p>
  <code>npm install --save-dev winnetoujs;</code> Installs the framework in your project.
</p>

<p>
  <code>node wbr --scaffolding;</code> (Optional) Copies files from an initial WinnetouJS template project to your directory.
</p>

<h2>Configuration File</h2>
<p>
  Well, before we see how to start a WinnetouJs project and write our first constructo, it is necessary to understand the configuration of the project and also the file structure.

  The configuration file is called win.config.js and it is there that we define all the locations of the project files.
</p>

<p>This file needs to be in root of project, beside wbr.
</p>

<div class="codeOutput">
  <span class="code-file-name">win.config.js</span>
  <pre><code class="onloadCode">
      
export default {
    constructosPath: "./constructos",
    constructosOut: "./js/constructos",
    entry: "./js/app.js",
    out: "./release",
    sass: [
      {
        entryFolder: "./sass",
        outFolder: "./release",
      },
    ],
    icons: "./icons",
    publicPath: '/',
    defaultLang: "en-us",
};
     
    </code></pre>
</div>

<p>
  It must be at the same level as wbr.js and node_modules.
</p>

<p>
  If your server is configured to serve public in <code>/Public</code> folder and your winnetou implementation is within <code>/Public/winnetou-app</code> folder, your publicPath setting must be <code>/winnetou-app</code>.


</p>

<h2>Visual Studio Code and JSDoc</h2>
<p>
  WinnetouJs is passionate about VanillaJs and we believe in the potential and freedom of javascript. That's why we don't use any abstraction in our native code, like typescript for example. However, we believe in clean, maintainable and reusable code, so all classes generated by WBR have been fed by descriptions using <b>jsdoc</b>. As we recommend Visual Studio Code as an editor for Winnetou, we advise you to download/enable the extension that supports jsdoc within VSCode for a better development experience.</p>

<h2>jsconfig.json</h2>
<p>
  Visual Studio Code needs further setting file in order to constructos objects can be imported in your code just-in-time. This file needs to be beside wbr.</p>

<div class="codeOutput">
  <span class="code-file-name">jsconfig.json</span>
  <pre><code class="onloadCode">
        
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "es2020",
    "target": "es6",
    "checkJs": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/node_modules/*"]
}
       
      </code></pre>
</div>
