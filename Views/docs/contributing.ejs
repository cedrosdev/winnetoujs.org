<h1>Pull Requests Guidelines</h1>
<hr />
<p>Here you can find some important topics to make your pull request more effective.</p>

<h2>Clear Commit Messages</h2>
<p>
  While you understand your code and the reasons for your changes, the reviewer may not.
  Commit messages should clearly communicate the purpose and context of the changes.
</p>
<p>
  A great way to ensure clarity and consistency is by following the
  <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits Specification</a>, which uses the following format:
</p>
<p>

  <code>&lt;type&gt;[optional-scope]: &lt;description&gt;</code>

</p>

<p>

  <code>feat(shop-api): add voucher validation</code>

</p>
<p>
  This approach makes commit history easier to read and maintain, while also providing valuable context for future reference.
</p>

<h2>Crafting Meaningful Pull Requests</h2>
<p>
  A pull request is more than just a submission of code — it is an opportunity to provide context, clarify your intentions,
  and ensure that the changes you introduce align with the goals of the project. While commit messages are crucial for
  individual changes, the pull request as a whole should offer a clear and cohesive explanation of the work being done.
</p>
<p>
  In the spirit of maintaining clarity and consistency within the <strong>WinnetouJs</strong> documentation, we encourage
  the use of a standardized template for all pull requests. This helps both contributors and reviewers focus on what matters
  most: the substance of the changes and the intent behind them. A well-crafted pull request should include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Commit Type:</strong> A concise indication of the nature of your change (e.g., new feature, bug fix, or breaking change).</li>
  <li><strong>Ticket/Issue Reference:</strong> If applicable, link to any relevant issues, tickets, or discussions related to the PR.</li>
  <li><strong>What and Why:</strong> A brief description of what the PR accomplishes and the reasoning behind the changes, so reviewers
    can quickly understand the context and impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Adopting this approach streamlines the review process, making it easier for others to follow your work and collaborate effectively.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Following clear and consistent guidelines for pull requests ensures smooth collaboration and a streamlined review process.
  By providing concise, descriptive commit messages and well-organized PRs, you help maintain clarity within the <strong>WinnetouJs</strong> project.
</p>
<p>
  Adopting these practices will not only make your contributions easier to review, but also create a valuable and maintainable
  codebase that fosters collaboration. Always remember that communication is key — a well-crafted pull request tells the story of your
  changes, making it easier for others to understand, contribute, and provide meaningful feedback.
</p>
<p>
  Together, we can ensure that each contribution aligns with the vision of the project, improving the overall quality and
  coherence of <strong>WinnetouJs</strong>.
